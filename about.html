                    After demo, we have some valuable feedback from users and other classmates. So we made few changes
                    based
                    on this
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We hide the chapter buttons to the left and add the hover animation, so the both boat canvas and
                        the
                        album can be larger.</li>
                    <li>The worng photo choosing in the album now will be red. So user can know their choosing is right
                        or
                        wrong instead of jump back to read the captain's word.</li>
