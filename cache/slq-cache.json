He emigrated to New South Wales in 1838, and for many years worked for H. Dangar on his stations, eventually becoming his general manager. He went to Queensland and took up land, and in 1866 was returned to Parliament as member for Port Curtis. On 2 August 1867 he became colonial secretary and secretary for public works in the R. R. Mackenzie (q.v.) ministry, and in September 1868 secretary for public lands. Mackenzie resigned on 25 November 1868 and Palmer went into opposition. On 3 May 1870 he became premier and colonial secretary and in July 1873 secretary for public works. His ministry was defeated in January 1874. During his term of office acts were passed which led to much development on account of new railways. Palmer was colonial secretary and secretary for public instruction in the McIlwraith (q.v.) ministry which came into power in January 1879, but resigned these positions on 24 December 1881 to become president of the legislative council. He remained in that position until the end of his life. On several occasions he was administrator of the government between 1881 and 1898. He died at Toowong, Queensland on 20 March 1898, after a long illness. He married Miss C. J. Mosman in 1865, who died in 1885, and was survived by three sons and two daughters. He was created K.C.M.G. in 1881.

They acquired their first workshop in 1913. In July 1915 Evans joined the Australian Imperial Force as a lieutenant in the 2nd Divisional Engineers and served in Egypt and France. By the time his active service was terminated by wounds in February 1918 he was a major. In 1924 Evans became lieutenant-colonel commanding the 5th Division, Australian Engineers, and in 1930 colonel commanding the 11th Infantry Brigade. The engineering business, carried on during the war by Deakin, had prospered. Evans started a new workshop making small pieces of equipment in an outbuilding of his Coorparoo home in 1919. A larger establishment was bought in 1922. A new large workshop built at Rocklea for structural steel and railway-engine repairs in 1926 was ready to manufacture the steel work for the Story Bridge in 1933. Evans was in uniform again at the outbreak of World War II as chief engineer, Northern Command. In addition he established the Evans Deakin shipyard at Kangaroo Point. Evans retired in 1948 and died of cancer in Brisbane on 1 December 1951.

In 1922 he came to Brisbane and commenced business on his own account in Fortitude Valley, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1958. His work was distinguished by the use of Queensland timbers, particularly Queensland maple and silky oak, together with elaborate carving and marquetry inlay. His best known public commissions include the invitation to furnish a bedroom at Government House, Brisbane, for the visit of the Duke of Gloucester in 1934, and a jewel case intended for the (then) Duchess of York.

She studied art at All Hallows School where she was taught by William Bustard. After leaving school, she worked for a time sketching ideas for rooms incorporating the furniture designs of her father. After a period studying art in England, Wales, Italy and France in the late 1940's she returned to Brisbane to begin a fruitful period during which she was inspired by the Queensland landscape.","dc:publisher":"John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland","dc:contributor":"","dc:type":"image","dc:format":"Digital format: image/jpeg Original format: copy print : b&w","dc:identifier":"Negative number: 52853 ","dc:source":"Item is held by John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland.","dc:language":"","dcterms:isPartOf":"Accession number: 7648 View related images: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/comp/115 Collection reference: 7648 Rosenstengel Collection of Copy Prints View finding aid: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/eadarc/7081 Is part of: Picture Queensland ~ State Library of Queensland : digital image collection ","dcterms:spatial":"Brisbane, Queensland; -27.46888,153.022827","dcterms:temporal":"ca. 1939","dc:rights":"Copyright expired.

The glazed bricks were locally manufactured by James Campbell. In 1900 the Queensland Museum decided to move to and adapt the Exhibition Hall for a museum, after twenty years in a smaller purpose built building in William Street (which became the State Library). Alterations included the construction of a gallery within the main hall, addition of a line of windows in the main northern wall and the modification of the basement dining rooom into offices, preparation and storage spaces. The Queensland Museum moved into new premises in the South Bank precinct in 1987.

This building was erected in 1864/6 and was designed by Cowlishaw and Taylor. In December 1872, the Queensland National Bank purchased the North Brisbane School of Arts land and building for the sum of 8000, as the site for its new head office. However the School of Arts leased back the building until they moved into their new building in Ann Street in 1878. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the School of Arts played an important role in the cultural life of the community, providing a library for members, conducting public lectures, and providing organised classes in a wide variety of subjects.

The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek.

In the front from the left are: Douglas, Ernest, Gertrude, Lillian, Grace and William. (Description supplied with photograph) The Grimes family arrived in Brisbane on the 'Chasely' one of Dr Lang s boats, in 1849. They came with their families from Warwickshire in England. William Grimes began as an assistant in the drapery department of Richardson s store until it became Grimes and Petty and moved to Queen Street. Other family members bought a ridge in Dutton Park to grow potatoes and maize. They were experienced farmers and by 1857 George Grimes had started an arrowroot farm called 'Fairfield'. At one time the Grimes family owned most of Fairfield as farms and a dairy. George and Samuel Grimes owned three farms in the Yeerongpilly/Tennyson area. In 1862 they were experimenting with arrowroot production there and by 1863 they had an arrowroot mill and drying kiln. They grew sugar and had a sugar mill, Coongoon, until it burnt down in 1876. In 1878, George and Samuel bought nine acres at Yeronga, which were transferred to William in 1885. Here they built 'Kadumba' which was designed by prominent architect Richard Gailey. The family were staunch Baptists. In 1862 they gave land for a Mission Hall, which was built in 1865, and later became the Fairfield Baptist Church. William Grimes was the first to hold services there. Samuel went on to become a member of the Legislative Assembly and George was the second chairman of Stephens Shire. William Grimes died in 1896 and George Grimes died in 1910.

The region is unique for its wide seasonal variations, occasionally snowing in winter. The name Stanthorpe comes from the Latin word 'stannum', meaning tin, and the English word 'thorp', meaning village.

'Adderton' built by John Petrie for Dr George Fullerton was located at Duncans Hill and was bought for the sum of 6000 pounds. 'Adderton' still forms part of the central section of the present convent and the new school was called All Hallows. It is believed that the name came from the All Hallows college in Dublin.

Milton House was erected in 1852 or 1853 for retired Queen Street chemist Ambrose Eldridge.This hip-roofed house is Colonial Georgian in style and plan, having a typical front doorway with segmented sidelights with arched fanlight, and a symmetrical arrangement of rooms radiating off a central hallway on each floor. The ground floor has wide, open verandahs on three sides. Two service rooms run across the rear of the house incorporating pavilion wings off the side verandahs. The walls are of brick, which is lime rendered and jointed to give the impression of stone. A three-roomed cellar is constructed of rough rubble walling, and entered by steps on the south side of the verandah. The roof is covered in shingles. Milton House was originally built as a homestead, high on the riverbank overlooking the surrounding property and survives sufficiently in form, feature and material, to be important in demonstrating the principal features of Colonial Georgian architecture adapted to local climatic conditions, notably through the inclusion of verandahs and french doors on three sides.

The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek.

If you are able to assist with identification, please click on the Feedback tab. Richard Daintree, geologist and photographer, was born in 1832 in Huntingdonshire, England. He matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1851 and in 1852 joined the gold rush to Victoria. Unsuccessful as a prospector he became assistant geologist in the Victorian Geological Survey until 1856. On a visit to England he became interested in photography and when he rejoined the Geological Survey in 1859 he pioneered the use of photography in field-work. In 1864 he became a resident partner with William Hann in pastoral properties in the Burdekin country of North Queensland. There he was able to indulge his passions for both photography and prospecting. When the pastoral boom collapsed he used his knowledge to open up goldfields at Cape River (1867), Gilbert (1869) and Etheridge in 1869-70. Daintree advocated a geological survey of Queensland and when it began in 1868 he was geologist in charge of the northern division until 1870. In that year he made some of his finest photographic studies. In 1871 his collection of photographs and geological specimens formed the mainstray of Queensland's contribution to the Exhibition of Art and Industry in London. He was sent to England as commissioner in charge of this display, although much of it was lost when the ship carrying Daintree and his family was wrecked. In London he was appointed Queensland's agent-general in 1872. Due to ill health Daintree resigned in 1876 and died in Kent on the 20th June, 1878. His photographs , taken under difficult conditions by the cumbersome wet-plate process, are superb specimens of the art and present a vivid picture of early settlement in Queensland.

The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek.

Meek's house in Bardon, still under construction. The house, designed to suit the land, stands at 43 feet above ground level at the back and only 15 feet above footpath level at the front. A concrete catwalk leads from the street into the lounge and vestibule, situated in the peak of the high pitched roof. On the floor below are the kitchen, dining room, bathroom and maid's room, while the next floor down contains three bedrooms and a sleep-out. The pitch of the roof was so steep that the tiles had to be fixed by hand from the inside and pinned with special clips. The estimated final cost at the time the photograph was taken was 3, 500. The suburb of Bardon was named after Bardon House, built by Joshua Jeays, an architect and a partner of Andrew Petrie in the construction of the Petrie Terrace Goal. Bardon House was named after Jeays' birthplace, Bardon Hill in Leicestershire, England. Joshua Jeays was an alderman of the first Municipality of Brisbane from 1859 to 1864, when he became the Mayor. The area that is now Bardon was first surveyed on 12 November, 1862. This was followed by the sale of the land, with only three buyers showing interest: Joshua Jeays, Francis Lyon and Edward Wyndham Tufnell. Tufnell became the first Anglican Bishop of Brisbane. Another person of influence to live in Bardon was Sir Charles Lilley, the editor of the Moreton Bay Courier and Premier of Queensland from 1868 to 1870. Sir Charles played an important role in the introduction of the Education Act of 1875, which provided free education to all. Landmarks of Bardon include a 70 feet high water tower built in 1927 to supply water to the higher parts of Brisbane, and 'Fernberg' house, now the Government House. The house was built in 1865 by J. C. Heussler and purchased by the government in 1910. Another famous feature of Bardon is Ithaca Creek, named after the birthplace in Greece of Lady Bowen, wife of the first governor of Queensland.

It was made by Thomas and Walter Trevethan in their Coach Works in Neil Street, Toowoomba in 1901-2, largely to their own design. In 1903 it was driven down the Toowoomba range and on to the coast at Redcliffe, north of Brisbane. The lack of suitable oils for engine lubrication and a primitive transmission brake which operated through a chain to the rear wheels made such extended journeys a great challenge. The car was seriously damaged after being charged by bullocks in 1915 and subsequently spent many years lying in sheds and under houses, but has now been restored by veteran car enthusiast Ross Flewell-Smith, and is part of the RACQ's 'Bulldust to Bitumen...and Beyond' touring exhibition.

Both buildings have numerous advertising signs painted on them. Eidsvold is a Norwegian named town in the Burnett River country of central Queensland. The area was first settled in 1848 by the Scottish Archer brothers, Charles and Thomas, who migrated to Australia from Norway, to where their parents had moved in 1825. Eidsvold s halcyon days followed the discovery of gold in 1887 and the region kept producing ore for more than 60 years before it ran out. Today, the town the Archer brothers named for their parent s adopted homeland is the commercial centre for prime beef producers. The nearby Waruma Dam is a playground for swimmers, sailors and water-skiers.

The cyclone and the accompanying deluge (about 266mm were registered) wreaked havoc in the town of Mackay and particularly on the waterfront. Buildings were partially destroyed, unroofed, and overturned; Croker's stores on the riverfront were flattened. The ship 'Tay' although in reasonable condition, and the barge 'Apa' were aground on the north bank, and the Sydney Street Bridge no longer spanned the river (Information taken from: please view TimeWalks http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/timewalks/mackay_1926/5088_132577.htm ).

For some period after the eye passed through Mackay the outside world had no real idea of the devastation, as all communications had been cut: telegraph lines were down and dangerous seas prevented any navigation to the port of Mackay. The cyclone and the accompanying deluge (about 266mm were registered) wreaked havoc in the town of Mackay and particularly on the waterfront. Buildings were partially destroyed, unroofed, and overturned; Croker's stores on the riverfront were flattened. The ship 'Tay' although in reasonable condition, and the barge 'Apa' were aground on the north bank, and the Sydney Street Bridge no longer spanned the river (Information taken from: please view TimeWalks http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/timewalks/mackay_1926/5088_132577.htm ).

The Gangulu tribe inhabited the area before European settlement. Ludwig Leichhardt explored the region in 1844. Today, water from artesian bores irrigates crops of lucerne and cotton. The area is rich in coal with the Callide power stations producing about 20 per cent of Queensland's electricity. Beef production is also a major industry and the Biloela meat works are the third largest in Queensland.

For some period after the eye passed through Mackay the outside world had no real idea of the devastation, as all communications had been cut: telegraph lines were down and dangerous seas prevented any navigation to the port of Mackay. The cyclone and the accompanying deluge (about 266mm were registered) wreaked havoc in the town of Mackay and particularly on the waterfront. Buildings were partially destroyed, unroofed, and overturned; Croker's stores on the riverfront were flattened. The ship 'Tay' although in reasonable condition, and the barge 'Apa' were aground on the north bank, and the Sydney Street Bridge no longer spanned the river (Information taken from: please view TimeWalks http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/timewalks/mackay_1926/5088_132577.htm ).

For some period after the eye passed through Mackay the outside world had no real idea of the devastation, as all communications had been cut: telegraph lines were down and dangerous seas prevented any navigation to the port of Mackay. The cyclone and the accompanying deluge (about 266mm were registered) wreaked havoc in the town of Mackay and particularly on the waterfront. Buildings were partially destroyed, unroofed, and overturned; Croker's stores on the riverfront were flattened. The ship 'Tay' although in reasonable condition, and the barge 'Apa' were aground on the north bank, and the Sydney Street Bridge no longer spanned the river (Information taken from: please view TimeWalks http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/timewalks/mackay_1926/5088_132577.htm ).

On the 5th the Indooroopilly Bridge was washed away; pm the 6th the northern end of Victoria Bridge disappeared; flood waters rose at Brisbane to 23 feet 9 inches above mean spring tide and 10 feet over the previous highest flood mark (1890). Similar disaster befell other towns where bridges and houses disappeared by the hundreds; at Gympie many of the mines were blown up; much loss of life reported particularly from Ipswich. Rainfall at Crohamhurst, head of Brisbane water was 105 inches between 1st January and 11th February. A second flood almost reaching the level of the first was experienced on the 19th, a lesser one having prevailed on the 13th. South Brisbane was without fresh water for some days and the whole of Brisbane practically in darkness at night. A very large relief fund (70,000 pounds) was established, subscriptions in money and in kind arriving from England as well as from the other colonies.

The suburb of Dutton Park was originally known as Bloggo, which became corrupted to Boggo and thus gave the name to Boggo Road (now known as Annerley Road). The area was eventually renamed Dutton Park after Charles Boydell Dutton who was the Queensland Minister for Lands from 1883 to 1887. Originally the district was not popular with settlers because of early plans for the construction of the South Brisbane Cemetery and gaol. However the area eventually found favour due to its proximity to the city and the development of public transport. The South Coast Railway was built through the district and a station was opened at Dutton Park in 1884. Land was initially bought for farming, however residential development soon followed after the introduction of the tramline in 1908.

In 1868 Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, laid the foundation stone at the School's original site in Roma Street. The school opened in February 1869 with ninety-four students and four masters under the leadership of Headmaster, Thomas Harlin. In 1881, the school was moved to its present site at Gregory Terrace and the magnificent Neo-Gothic style Great Hall and classrooms were opened that year. The building was designed by architect James Cowlishaw. With the opening of the Boarding House in 1886, the school became one of the first to provide unified boarding facilities on site.

This Customs House, located at the corner of Sydney and River Streets, was completed in April 1902. The design of the building is attributed to J. S. Murdoch, District Architect with the Queensland Works Department. It was constructed by M. S. Caskie. The Customs House is a single storey brick building with a curved entrance colonnade with doric columns supporting a moulded entablature. At its centre is a raised parapet with the Royal coat of arms in relief at its centre. Whilst the Commonwealth Bank occupied the building the Customs service was moved back into the adjacent timber building. In 1969-70 extensions were made to the rear of the building and in the late 1980s conservation and restoration works were undertaken. In 2004 the Customs House was sold to the present owners and currently houses a financial planning firm.

In 1883 a design competition for a two-storeyed building was won by Melbourne architects Grainger and D'Ebro. However this design was never used as the Queensland Colonial Architect, John James Clark, argued that the site warranted a four-storeyed complex. Clark's own design, entered in the competition prior to his appointment, was used. When completed in September 1889, the new building was occupied by the Premier, Colonial secretary, Registrar-General, Treasury, Mines, Works, Police and Auditor-General. Stage two which completed the Elizabeth Street section was commenced almost immediately and was completed by February 1893. This new wing was occupied by the Registrar of Titles, Justice, Works, Public Instruction and the State Savings Bank. Work on the third state commenced in 1922 and officially opened in 1928, providing expanded accomodation for the existing tenants. The building is now home to an international casino and restaurants.

It is situated on Lagoon Creek and is the centre of a pastoral area devoted to the production of sheep and some beef cattle. There is good supply of artesian water and the town's wide streets are lined with flowering shade trees. Barcaldine is known as the Garden City of the West. The town takes its name from Barcaldine Downs Station, which was named by Donald Charles Cameron, a pioneer pastoralist who had stayed with family in Barcaldine, Ayrshire before migrating to Australia. Barcaldine figured prominently in the 1891 shearers' strike, when 400 shearers camped on the fringes of the town for several months protesting the use of non-union labour. The strike gave birth to the political Labor movement. In the following year Thomas Ryan, a member of the state committee, became the first endorsed Labor candidate in the Australian parliament.

On the third floor a large room facing the whole length of George Street was allotted to the Trustees of the Qld. National Art Gallery for the collection of works of art. The building, which later became the Land Administration Building, was entirely faced with stone. Granite was used for the base, course and plinth, with freestone above. It was erected on the site of Brisbane's first electric telegraph office and the former convict settlement's parsonage, later the commissariat officers' quarters. The gardens established adjacent to the building were initially known as the Executive Gardens. On 23 June 1906 a bronze statue of Queen Victoria was unveiled by the Governor.

(Description supplied with photograph) The suburb of Dutton Park was originally known as Bloggo, which became corrupted to Boggo and thus gave the name to Boggo Road (now known as Annerley Road). The area was eventually renamed Dutton Park after Charles Boydell Dutton who was the Queensland Minister for Lands from 1883 to 1887. Originally the district was not popular with settlers because of early plans for the construction of the South Brisbane Cemetery and gaol. However the area eventually found favour due to its proximity to the city and the development of public transport. The South Coast Railway was built through the district and a station was opened at Dutton Park in 1884. Land was initially bought for farming, however residential development soon followed after the introduction of the tramline in 1908.

Then standing at centre back is Sidney Charles Sawyer, son of J. D. Sawyer and his wife. He was born 19 July 1881 in Brisbane, married in 6 November 1907 and died 7 July 1964. Sidney Sawyer later became a jeweller and one of his works, a buckle and belt, was in the Victoria and Albert Museum. He worked for Flavelle, Roberts and Sankey for a time, around 1904, and had a shop in Elizabeth Street, Brisbane around 1916-17.

His father was a tabacconist and Jessie may also have been one. He owned land at South Brisbane. The two girls are Ida May who was the older, born 19 December 1885 and Ruby Jane born 15 May 1887.

Clayfield was presumably named because of its former importance in the brickmaking industry. There were several clay pits in the area in the late 1800s. The name 'Clayfield' first appears in the Post Office records in 1891 as a section in the Hamilton and Toombul Streets Directory. However the area was settled well before this, some time between 1853 and 1858. The area was popular because of its proximity to the city and sought after elevated breezes. In 1855 the pastoralist, James Sutherland, became the owner of a substantial amount of land in the Toombul Parish, including land in Clayfield. The tramway was opened to Clayfield in 1899 and soon after shops began to appear at its terminus. This tram service was discontinued in 1969 and replaced by buses. Clayfield today is one of the prestige suburbs of Brisbane boasting many fine houses and gardens, combined with tree-lined streets.

The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek.

The suburb of Bardon was named after Bardon House, built by Joshua Jeays, an architect and a partner of Andrew Petrie in the construction of the Petrie Terrace Goal. Bardon House was named after Jeays' birthplace, Bardon Hill in Leicestershire, England. Joshua Jeays was an alderman of the first Municipality of Brisbane from 1859 to 1864, when he became the Mayor. The area that is now Bardon was first surveyed on 12 November, 1862. This was followed by the sale of the land, with only three buyers showing interest: Joshua Jeays, Francis Lyon and Edward Wyndham Tufnell. Tufnell became the first Anglican Bishop of Brisbane. Another person of influence to live in Bardon was Sir Charles Lilley, the editor of the Moreton Bay Courier and Premier of Queensland from 1868 to 1870. Sir Charles played an important role in the introduction of the Education Act of 1875, which provided free education to all. Landmarks of Bardon include a 70 feet high water tower built in 1927 to supply water to the higher parts of Brisbane, and 'Fernberg' house, now the Government House. The house was built in 1865 by J. C. Heussler and purchased by the government in 1910. Another famous feature of Bardon is Ithaca Creek, named after the birthplace in Greece of Lady Bowen, wife of the first governor of Queensland.

Archbishop Quinn lived there from his arrival in 1861, and his successor, Archbishop Dunne, lived there until travelling to Rome in 1890. It was during Dunne's absence that the old residence was demolished and replaced by the new one, which was ready for his return in 1891. It appears that the residence was on the site of the proposed Holy Name Cathedral, which is near Duncan Street, Fortitude Valley, where Duncan's name is perpetuated. The Archbishop's residence, Dara, was demolished and a new residence built on the site.

The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek.

The cyclone and the accompanying deluge (about 266mm were registered) wreaked havoc in the town of Mackay and particularly on the waterfront. Buildings were partially destroyed, unroofed, and overturned; Croker's stores on the riverfront were flattened. The ship 'Tay' although in reasonable condition, and the barge 'Apa' were aground on the north bank, and the Sydney Street Bridge no longer spanned the river (Information taken from: please view TimeWalks http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/timewalks/mackay_1926/5088_132577.htm ).

(Description supplied with photograph) Auctioneers: Barnes & Co. Ltd., Roma St., Brisbane. Surveyors: R.A. Hamilton & James, 171 Queen Street. Brookfield, regarded as one of Brisbane's later developing suburbs, actually was one of the earliest areas settled. The fertile country in the district was farmed as early as 1850 with dairying and small crops being the main occupation. By the early 1870s population growth warranted the establishment of the first primary school in the area. Timber getting was also an early industry and there are the remains of a number of old gold mines in the district. Brookfield remained a quiet farming community until recent years when it became one of Brisbane's 'Green Belt' suburbs with larger housing blocks preserving the pleasant bush setting. Brookfield was named by either Mrs L. Logan, an early resident, because of the abundance of meadows, creeks and gullies, or by Mrs Lucinda Brimblecombe in 1868 at a residents' meeting to give the district a name. Mrs Brimblecombe is reported to have suggested that since the area had so many flowing brooks the district should be called Brookfield.

Development was slow until 1875 when a rail service was provided from Brisbane, after which houses and firms soon sprang up. In 1876 the first railway bridge was built. This was swept away in the disastrous 1893 flood, but was rebuilt. The Walter Taylor Bridge (commonly known as the Indooroopilly Toll Bridge) was built in 1936 and linked Indooroopilly to Chelmer.

The Sisters of Mercy took possession in late 1905, after Patrick Perkins death, and prepared the builiding for use as the first Mater Misericordiae Hospital which opened in January 1906. The Synagogue was turned into a chapel, later owners used it as a billard room. The Mater Hospital, had 20 beds, at a charge per patient of three guineas a week. In September, 1910, patients were transferred to the new Mater Private Hospital on College Hill (now Mater Hill), South Brisbane. After the closure of the North Quay house, its name was changed to, Loretto, and it became a hostel for Catholic girls from the country who came to work in Brisbane. It was demolished ca. 1939 to make way for the Church of Christ Scientist.

The first stage consisted of the central portion with a transverse gabled wing to the left hand end. Another transverse gabled wing was added at the right hand end in 1901, completing the symmetry of the building. The gabled ends have pilasters rising up through two storeys and terminating in three semi-circular arches above the upper storey windows. The date of construction of each wing is inscribed in raised lettering below each central upper window. The central portion of the facade consists of a ground floor arcaded verandah with a central semi-circular arch leading to the central entrance door. This semi-circular arch is repeated on the upper verandah and is surmounted by a central gabled roof. Timber finials and decorative timber fretwork are at the end of each gable.

The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek. Fruit growing and winemaking are the two main industries in Stanthorpe today.

It is a classical two storey rendered brick building, designed by Brockwell Gill, that was constructed in stages from 1892. The first stage consisted of the central portion with a transverse gabled wing to the left hand end. Another transverse gabled wing was added at the right hand end in 1901, completing the symmetry of the building. The gabled ends have pilasters rising up through two storeys and terminating in three semi-circular arches above the upper storey windows. The date of construction of each wing is inscribed in raised lettering below each central upper window. The central portion of the facade consists of a ground floor arcaded verandah with a central semi-circular arch leading to the central entrance door. This semi-circular arch is repeated on the upper verandah and is surmounted by a central gabled roof. Timber finials and decorative timber fretwork are at the end of each gable.

The name Stanthorpe comes from the Latin word 'stannum', meaning tin, and the English word 'thorp' meaning village. The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek. Fruit growing and winemaking are the two main industries in Stanthorpe today.

The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek.

The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek. Fruit growing and winemaking are the two main industries in Stanthorpe today.

For some period after the eye passed through Mackay the outside world had no real idea of the devastation, as all communications had been cut: telegraph lines were down and dangerous seas prevented any navigation to the port of Mackay. The cyclone and the accompanying deluge (about 266mm were registered) wreaked havoc in the town of Mackay and particularly on the waterfront. Buildings were partially destroyed, unroofed, and overturned; Croker's stores on the riverfront were flattened. The ship 'Tay' although in reasonable condition, and the barge 'Apa' were aground on the north bank, and the Sydney Street Bridge no longer spanned the river (Information taken from: please view TimeWalks http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/timewalks/mackay_1926/5088_132577.htm ).

The suburb of Dutton Park was originally known as Bloggo, which became corrupted to Boggo and thus gave the name to Boggo Road (now known as Annerley Road). The area was eventually renamed Dutton Park after Charles Boydell Dutton who was the Queensland Minister for Lands from 1883 to 1887. Originally the district was not popular with settlers because of early plans for the construction of the South Brisbane Cemetery and gaol. However the area eventually found favour due to its proximity to the city and the development of public transport. The South Coast Railway was built through the district and a station was opened at Dutton Park in 1884. Land was initially bought for farming, however residential development soon followed after the introduction of the tramline in 1908.

Queenslands gift to Wales. The bardic chair to be presented to the winning bard at the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales this year will be a gift from Queensland. It is of Queensland design, workmanship, and materials, except for the tapestry seat which was specially made in England, but which is typically Queensland in motif, bearing a representation of two koalas. The most striking part of the chair is its back panel of satin ash, carved in bas relief and polychromed with Welsh scenery and traditional Welsh figures. At the top are Snowden and Harlech Castles, and lower down on the panel are scenes of Welsh life, with a meeting of the gorsedd, the opening of the Eisteddford, in the bottom left-hand corner, and a Welsh ministrel with harp and boy in the bottom right-hand corner. The chair is surmounted by the Queensland coat of arms, surrounded by a wreath. This wreath and the torch on the stretcher bars underneath the seat are symbols of victory. At the top of each column is a Tudor crown, in recognition of the fact that Wales supplied England with its first Tudor king, Henry VII. The front legs are of cup and cover design, and the back legs are carved in late Gothic style. The principal wood used is bronzed maple. The chair, which has been constructed to last for centuries, was designed and manufactured by Mr Edward Rosenstangel in his Brunswick Street factory. The Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales will be held this year at Machynlleth, and the time will be, as usual, the first week in August. Mr E. A. Rawson, president of the Association of Welsh Societies of Australia, will leave for Britain on the Orama on March 17, and will personally present the chair to the Esiteddfod authorities. It will be the second bardic chair from Queensland, the first having been sent from Ipswich in 1927. Accompanying letter from the National Library of Wales dated 2 December 1982 reads: Our annual National Eisteddfod was held in 1937 in Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire . The chair was donated by the Brisbane St. Davids Society and was won for an ode on Y Ffin (The Border) by T. Rowland Hughes (1903-1949) who later became a successful novelist.","dc:publisher":"John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland","dc:contributor":"Courier-mail (Brisbane, Qld.)","dc:type":"image","dc:format":"Digital format: image/jpeg Original format: copy print : b&w","dc:identifier":"Negative number: 19720 ","dc:source":"Item is held by John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland Copied and digitised from an image appearing in The Courier-Mail, 2 March 1937","dc:language":"","dcterms:isPartOf":"Is part of: Picture Queensland ~ State Library of Queensland : digital image collection ","dcterms:spatial":"Queensland","dcterms:temporal":"2 March 1937","dc:rights":"Copyright expired.

The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek.

The name Stanthorpe comes from the Latin word 'stannum', meaning tin, and the English word 'thorp' meaning village. The town grew around a coaching station established in 1857 and boomed in 1872 when tin was discovered near Quart Pot Creek. Fruit growing and winemaking are the two main industries in Stanthorpe today.

The ground floor has wide, open verandahs on three sides. Two service rooms run across the rear of the house incorporating pavilion wings off the side verandahs. The walls are of brick, which is lime rendered and jointed to give the impression of stone. A three-roomed cellar is constructed of rough rubble walling, and entered by steps on the south side of the verandah. The roof is covered in shingles. Milton House was originally built as a homestead, high on the riverbank overlooking the surrounding property and survives sufficiently in form, feature and material, to be important in demonstrating the principal features of Colonial Georgian architecture adapted to local climatic conditions, notably through the inclusion of verandahs and french doors on three sides.

(Images made by Boag are in the collection of the Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society.) Boag arrived in Queensland in November 1871. He travelled around the south-east, along the foreshore of Moreton Bay and the township of Cleveland. He then moved into the Logan and Albert area where he captured images of local crushing mills and sugar plantations. While at Yatala, he took on a partner, John Henry Mills, and by the end of 1872, both men were in Stanthorpe where they remained for several months, producing views of the booming tin-mining settlement. In July 1873, after stopping off in Warwick, Boag and Mills extended their operations to Mackay, where they remained until October 1875. During this time, Boag made trips to St Lawrence and Cooktown, however his movements after this are difficult to trace. It is known that by mid 1876 he was at Copperfield and Clermont, and in February 1878, he inserted a notice in the Peak Downs Telegram announcing that he was leaving for the west. Then information ceases abruptly. It is possible that Boag never reached his destination, since his death certificate records that he died in 1878 at an unknown location. The Brighton Boarding House in Shore Street was constructed around 1851 by pastoralist Francis Bigge (of Mt Pleasant station). It was intended originally to be a dwelling house, but finding it too near the road, Bigge rented it out. After many changes, it became the Brighton Hotel, then, in the 1950s, it was renamed the Grand View hotel. At the time that this photograph was taken, Cleveland's principal attractions were a good supply of salt air and fresh seafood, or as one satirical observer reported, 'people come down here to eat oysters and fresh fish...and (to) wash and be clean'. Accomodation included two public houses, and board and lodging was to be had in 'almost every second humpy'. One eyesore was the Cleveland racecourse, located on the Government Reserve, which for a long time had been the favourite resort of pigs that were allowed to 'grub up' the turf in search of wild yams and other delicacies, leaving large holes which made the ground unsightly and dangerous.","dc:publisher":"John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland","dc:contributor":"","dc:type":"image","dc:format":"Digital format: image/jpeg Original format: copy print : b&w","dc:identifier":"Negative number: 20278 ","dc:source":"Item is held by John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland.","dc:language":"","dcterms:isPartOf":"Accession number: 7669 View related images: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/comp/95 Collection reference: GS-66 William Boag Photograph Albums View finding aid: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/eadarc/7090 Is part of: Album: GS-66 Is part of: Picture Queensland ~ State Library of Queensland : digital image collection ","dcterms:spatial":"Cleveland, Queensland; -27.526529,153.267105","dcterms:temporal":"1871","dc:rights":"Copyright expired.

During this time, Boag made trips to St Lawrence and Cooktown, however his movements after this are difficult to trace. It is known that by mid 1876 he was at Copperfield and Clermont, and in February 1878, he inserted a notice in the Peak Downs Telegram announcing that he was leaving for the west. Then information ceases abruptly. It is possible that Boag never reached his destination, since his death certificate records that he died in 1878 at an unknown location.","dc:publisher":"John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland","dc:contributor":"","dc:type":"image","dc:format":"Digital format: image/jpeg Original format: copy print : b&w","dc:identifier":"Negative number: 20187 ","dc:source":"Item is held by John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland.","dc:language":"","dcterms:isPartOf":"Accession number: 7669 View related images: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/comp/95 Collection reference: GS-66 William Boag Photograph Albums View finding aid: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/eadarc/7090 Is part of: Album: GS-66 Is part of: Picture Queensland ~ State Library of Queensland : digital image collection ","dcterms:spatial":"Brisbane, Queensland; -27.46888,153.022827","dcterms:temporal":"ca. 1872","dc:rights":"Copyright expired.

(Images made by Boag are in the collection of the Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society.) Boag arrived in Queensland in November 1871. He travelled around the south-east, along the foreshore of Moreton Bay and the township of Cleveland. He then moved into the Logan and Albert area where he captured images of local crushing mills and sugar plantations. While at Yatala, he took on a partner, John Henry Mills, and by the end of 1872, both men were in Stanthorpe where they remained for several months, producing views of the booming tin-mining settlement. In July 1873, after stopping off in Warwick, Boag and Mills extended their operations to Mackay, where they remained until October 1875. During this time, Boag made trips to St Lawrence and Cooktown, however his movements after this are difficult to trace. It is known that by mid 1876 he was at Copperfield and Clermont, and in February 1878, he inserted a notice in the Peak Downs Telegram announcing that he was leaving for the west. Then information ceases abruptly. It is possible that Boag never reached his destination, since his death certificate records that he died in 1878 at an unknown location. This boarding house was owned by John Menzies, a former licensed victualler, and was situated between Margaret and Mary streets. It probably had just been erected when William Boag arrived back in town from Cleveland to photograph Brisbane's houses, shops and public buildings.","dc:publisher":"John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland","dc:contributor":"","dc:type":"image","dc:format":"Digital format: image/jpeg Original format: copy print : b&w","dc:identifier":"Negative number: 78144 ","dc:source":"Item is held by John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland.","dc:language":"","dcterms:isPartOf":"Accession number: 7669 View related images: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/comp/95 Collection reference: GS-66 William Boag Photograph Albums View finding aid: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/eadarc/7090 Is part of: Album: GS-66 Is part of: Picture Queensland ~ State Library of Queensland : digital image collection ","dcterms:spatial":"Brisbane, Queensland; -27.46888,153.022827","dcterms:temporal":"ca. 1872","dc:rights":"Copyright expired.

The Gangulu tribe inhabited the area before European settlement. Ludwig Leichhardt explored the region in 1844. Today, water from artesian bores irrigates crops of lucerne and cotton. The area is rich in coal with the Callide power stations producing about 20 per cent of Queensland's electricity. Beef production is also a major industry and the Biloela meat works are the third largest in Queensland.

There were several clay pits in the area in the late 1800s. The name 'Clayfield' first appears in the Post Office records in 1891 as a section in the Hamilton and Toombul Streets Directory. However the area was settled well before this, some time between 1853 and 1858. The area was popular because of its proximity to the city and sought after elevated breezes. In 1855 the pastoralist, James Sutherland, became the owner of a substantial amount of land in the Toombul Parish, including land in Clayfield. Clayfield today is one of the prestige suburbs of Brisbane boasting many fine houses and gardens, combined with tree-lined streets.

He was later to work in Sydney, Auckland, Vancouver and Grand Rapids (USA), as well as in England and Europe, before returning to Toowoomba in 1911. In 1922 he came to Brisbane and commenced business on his own account in Fortitude Valley, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1958. His work was distinguished by the use of Queensland timbers, particularly Queensland maple and silky oak, together with elaborate carving and marquetry inlay. His best known public commissions include the invitation to furnish a bedroom at Government House, Brisbane, for the visit of the Duke of Gloucester in 1934, and a jewel case intended for the (then) Duchess of York. (Information taken from: K. Fahy and A. Simpson, Australian furniture: Pictorial history and dictionary 1788-1938, 1998.) Rosenstengel operated out of premises located at 524 Brunswick Street, Fortitude Valley, from 1922 to 1958.","dc:publisher":"John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland","dc:contributor":"","dc:type":"image","dc:format":"Digital format: image/jpeg Original format: copy print : hand col.","dc:identifier":"Negative number: 56924 ","dc:source":"Item is held by John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland.","dc:language":"","dcterms:isPartOf":"Accession number: 7648 View related images: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/comp/115 Collection reference: 7648 Rosenstengel Collection of Copy Prints View finding aid: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/eadarc/7081 Is part of: Picture Queensland ~ State Library of Queensland : digital image collection ","dcterms:spatial":"Brisbane, Queensland; -27.46888,153.022827","dcterms:temporal":"1946","dc:rights":"Copyright expired.

(Description supplied with photograph) The furniture includes carved wooden pieces: a wardrobe, bed, mirrored dressing table and stool, occasional chairs and a highboy. Edmund Rosenstengel (1887-1962) was born in Toowoomba. He learnt his trade as a cabinet-maker apprenticed to the business of Rosenstengel & Kleimeyer. He was later to work in Sydney, Auckland, Vancouver and Grand Rapids (USA), as well as in England and Europe, before returning to Toowoomba in 1911. In 1922 he came to Brisbane and commenced business on his own account in Fortitude Valley, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1958. His work was distinguished by the use of Queensland timbers, particularly Queensland maple and silky oak, together with elaborate carving and marquetry inlay. His best known public commissions include the invitation to furnish a bedroom at Government House, Brisbane, for the visit of the Duke of Gloucester in 1934, and a jewel case intended for the (then) Duchess of York.

In 1922 he came to Brisbane and commenced business on his own account in Fortitude Valley, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1958. His work was distinguished by the use of Queensland timbers, particularly Queensland maple and silky oak, together with elaborate carving and marquetry inlay. His best known public commissions include the invitation to furnish a bedroom at Government House, Brisbane, for the visit of the Duke of Gloucester in 1934, and a jewel case intended for the (then) Duchess of York.

In the early 1830s convicts began clearing the land and building primitive roads. Ten years later wealthy free settlers took up land in areas where they could enjoy views of the Brisbane River. Ascot is now an affluent suburb featuring many imposing residences. The first racetrack in the area was opened in 1863, consisting of 332 acres of roughly cleared bushland and the area became a popular residential one for those concerned with the racing industry. Even as late as the 1920s there were racing stables throughout the suburb. Eagle Farm Racecourse, as it is now known, is the premier racecourse in Brisbane. The railway came to Ascot, then known as Hendra siding in 1882.

He learnt his trade as a cabinet-maker apprenticed to the business of Rosenstengel & Kleimeyer. He was later to work in Sydney, Auckland, Vancouver and Grand Rapids (USA), as well as in England and Europe, before returning to Toowoomba in 1911. In 1922 he came to Brisbane and commenced business on his own account in Fortitude Valley, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1958. His work was distinguished by the use of Queensland timbers, particularly Queensland maple and silky oak, together with elaborate carving and marquetry inlay. His best known public commissions include the invitation to furnish a bedroom at Government House, Brisbane, for the visit of the Duke of Gloucester in 1934, and a jewel case intended for the (then) Duchess of York. (Information taken from: K. Fahy and A. Simpson, Australian furniture: Pictorial history and dictionary 1788-1938, 1998.) Rosenstengel operated out of premises located at 524 Brunswick Street, Fortitude Valley, from 1922 to 1958. This image shows two rooms separated by sliding glass panelled doors at the Rosenstengel home at New Farm. The furniture in these rooms is elaborately carved and includes tables, cabinets, and velvet upholstered occasional chairs.","dc:publisher":"John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland","dc:contributor":"","dc:type":"image","dc:format":"Digital format: image/jpeg Original format: copy print : b&w","dc:identifier":"Negative number: 141079 ","dc:source":"Item is held by John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland.","dc:language":"","dcterms:isPartOf":"Accession number: 7648 View related images: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/comp/115 Collection reference: 7648 Rosenstengel Collection of Copy Prints View finding aid: http://hdl.handle.net/10462/eadarc/7081 Is part of: Picture Queensland ~ State Library of Queensland : digital image collection ","dcterms:spatial":"New Farm, Brisbane, Queensland; -27.4659,153.04451","dcterms:temporal":"ca. 1935","dc:rights":"Copyright expired.

In 1922 he came to Brisbane and commenced business on his own account in Fortitude Valley, where he was to remain until his retirement in 1958. His work was distinguished by the use of Queensland timbers, particularly Queensland maple and silky oak, together with elaborate carving and marquetry inlay. His best known public commissions include the invitation to furnish a bedroom at Government House, Brisbane, for the visit of the Duke of Gloucester in 1934, and a jewel case intended for the (then) Duchess of York.

The name of the town comes from an aboriginal word for 'white cockatoo'. The Gangulu tribe inhabited the area before European settlement. Ludwig Leichhardt explored the region in 1844. Today, water from artesian bores irrigates crops of lucerne and cotton. The area is rich in coal with the Callide power stations producing about 20 per cent of Queensland's electricity. Beef production is also a major industry and the Biloela meat works are the third largest in Queensland.
